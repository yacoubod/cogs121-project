The idea is still build the interface completely off of the map. Using the map to visualize the possible destinations connected to the area of departure. Since the app is meant to be used to find cheap flights, the flights are color coded according to their price as determined by the slider on the main bottom bar. Additional filters can be overlayed onto the map, underneath the flights to help visualize information about the destinations (rating system of the city/area, temperature, cost of living, hotels, etc). A list form of the destinations is also available but only emerges once the user begins to interact with the locations on the map.

This prototype demonstrates what the app would display after a search has been done. The dots represent available destinations, and when tapped, show details about the destination and price for a round trip there.

Idea for future iteration: add price slider, show prices above dots

My prototype shows that people can find trips that match their desired criteria such as travel duration, price, and area. Once a user has selected a trip from the list, they see a map view of where their travel, lodging, and activities will be located.
