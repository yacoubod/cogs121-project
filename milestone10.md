**Heilmeier Catechism Elevator Pitch**

*What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.*

We are building a travel booking website that is organized the way those with wanderlust think – instead of focusing on the details, what are all of my opportunities in the near future to cheaply travel?

*How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?*

Currently you need to know all of the details of your flight before you start exploring what tickets you can buy. This is more information than most "on-the-fence" travelers have, and because of this they don't travel as often.

*What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?*

Our approach does not require that you put in a lot of details about your flight. Instead you quickly find yourself on a map with the opportunities for cheap travel listed as pins around the map. The details aren't locked in, instead a range of opportunities are presented based on your departing location.

*Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?*

Because people want to travel but are not easily able to find upcoming opportunities that fit their budget, they don't travel as much as they might want to. The goal is to encourage people to travel and explore the world without making money the hard limit. If you have a flexible schedule and don't care where you go as long as you can get there cheaply, this is the tool for you. It's not the flight that people remember about their trip, but the memories they made while they were there. We want to lead people to those opportunities to make those priceless memories.
